# Step 6: Generate Structural Documentation

## Overview

OPTUM CS features a report generator. In the generated report all inputs and results are presented in a neat and organized way. The report can be used directly as a part of the structural documentation.

## Properties and outline

Edit report properties and generate report:

*   In the REPORT tab in the ribbon, locate the _Report_ pane on right hand side and add project title, subtitle and other relevant information.
*   In the _Report Outline_ on left hand side, remove the checkmark next to the sections named "Horizontal Load Definitions", "Horizontal Load Distribution" and "Appendix D Horizontal Load Distribution". These are not relevant when defining horizontal loads manually.
*   In the report pane click the _Generate_ button.
