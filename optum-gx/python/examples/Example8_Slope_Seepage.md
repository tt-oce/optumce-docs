# 8 Stability of slope subjected to unconfined seepage
In this example we consider the stability of a layered slope. The seepage pressure distribution and the location of the phreatic surface are not known a priori except that the groundwater table is located at the foot of the slope and the conditions at a distance of 15m from the crest of the slope correspond to hydrostatic conditions.
