# MCC Clay

The critical state models developed by Roscoe and his co-workers (Roscoe, 1968; Schofield, 1968) in the 1960s have been widely applied in geomechanics and form the basis of many subsequent models. The Modified Cam Clay (MCC) model of Roscoe (1968) has been particularly popular. A slightly modified and extended version of this model (including creep and a finite cohesion, while prohibiting crossing of the critical state line) is implemented in GX.

## Governing equations

### Elasticity

The volumetric and deviatoric stress–strain relations are given by

$$
\dot{\varepsilon}_v^e = \frac{1}{K}\dot p', \quad \varepsilon_q = \frac{1}{3G}\dot q
$$

where

$$
K = \frac{p'}{\kappa^*}, \quad G = \frac{3(1-2\nu)}{2(1+\nu)}K
$$

with $$\kappa^*$$ being a material parameter (the modified swelling modulus). The general 3D elastic stress–strain relation is:

$$
\dot{\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}} = \mathbb{C}^e \dot{\boldsymbol{\sigma}}
$$

where $$\mathbb{C}^e$$ is given in the Elasticity section.

### Yield and failure surfaces

The yield function is:

$$
F = q^2 - M^2 p'(p_c - p')
$$

where $$p_c$$ (the preconsolidation pressure) functions as a hardening variable, and

$$
M = \frac{3\sin\phi'}{\sqrt{3}\cos\theta + \sin\theta\sin\phi'}
$$

where $$\phi'$$ is the friction angle and $$\theta$$ is the Lode angle.

The yield surface represents an ellipse in $$p'-q$$ space whose size is governed by $$p_c$$. The line $$q = Mp'$$ passes through its apex — the critical state line. In the current implementation, crossing this line is prohibited. The critical state line acts as a Mohr–Coulomb failure line:

$$
F_f = |\sigma_1 - \sigma_3| + (\sigma_1 + \sigma_3)\sin\phi
$$

***

### Flow rules

For the yield surface (associated flow rule):

$$
\dot{\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}}^p = \dot{\lambda}\frac{\partial F}{\partial \boldsymbol{\sigma}}
$$

This implies compaction for all stress states on the yield surface, except at the top of the ellipse where $$\dot{\varepsilon}_v^p = 0$$.

For the failure surface (nonassociated flow rule):

$$
\dot{\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}}^p_f = \dot{\lambda}_f\frac{\partial G_f}{\partial \boldsymbol{\sigma}}
$$

where

$$
G_f = |\sigma_1 - \sigma_3|
$$

implying zero dilation.

***

### Hardening law

The change in $$p_c$$ is proportional to the plastic volumetric strain:

$$
\dot p_c = \frac{p_c}{\lambda^* - \kappa^*}\dot{\varepsilon}_v^p
$$

where $$\lambda^*$$ is the modified compression index. The yield surface expands ($$\dot p_c > 0$$) up to the critical state line ($$\dot p_c = 0$$).

***

### Cohesion

Cohesion is introduced by modifying the mean effective stress:

$$
\tilde{p}' = -\frac{1}{3}(\sigma_x' + \sigma_y' + \sigma_z') + \frac{c'}{\tan\phi'}
$$

***

### Creep

For certain clays, creep contributes significantly to total deformation. The empirical law is:

$$
\varepsilon_v^c = \frac{C_\alpha}{1+e}\log_{10}\left(\frac{t}{t_{90}}\right)
$$

and more generally between times $$t_n$$ and $$t_{n+1}$$:

$$
\Delta\varepsilon_v^c = \frac{C_\alpha}{1+e}\log_{10}\left(\frac{t_{n+1}}{t_n}\right)
$$

For a layer of depth $$H$$, the vertical settlement due to creep is:

$$
\Delta u^c = H\frac{C_\alpha}{1+e}\log_{10}\left(\frac{t_{n+1}}{t_n}\right)
$$

In OPTUM GX, creep follows Borja (1985):

$$
\boldsymbol{\varepsilon} = \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}^e + \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}^p + \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}^c
$$

with creep potential

$$
\frac{d\Phi^c}{dt} = \frac{\mu^*}{\tau_0}\exp\left(-\frac{1}{\mu^*}\Phi^e\right), \quad \Phi(0)=0
$$

and creep strain evolution

$$
\frac{d\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}^c}{dt} = \boldsymbol{a}\frac{d\Phi^c}{dt}
$$

where $$\boldsymbol{a} = \frac{\partial F^c}{\partial \boldsymbol{\sigma}'}$$ and

$$
F^c = \tilde{p}' + \frac{q^2}{M^2\tilde{p}'}
$$

Typically $$\mu^*/\lambda^*$$ ranges from 0.02–0.1 for natural materials prone to creep.

For 1D conditions:

$$
\varepsilon_v^c = \mu^*\ln\left(\frac{t + \tau_0}{\tau_0}\right)
$$

and

$$
\Delta\varepsilon_v^c = \mu^*\ln\left(\frac{t + \tau_0}{t_{90} + \tau_0}\right)
$$

which approaches the empirical form for $$t \gg \tau_0 = 1$$ day.

## Initial stresses and overconsolidation ratio

The overconsolidation ratio is:

$$
\text{OCR} = \frac{\sigma_{v,0}'}{\sigma_{c,0}}
$$

In the oedometer test (1D), the stresses at yield are:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\sigma_x'{}^* &= \sigma_{x,0}' + (\text{OCR} - 1)\frac{\nu}{1 - \nu}\sigma_{z,0}' \\
\sigma_y'{}^* &= \sigma_{y,0}' + (\text{OCR} - 1)\frac{\nu}{1 - \nu}\sigma_{z,0}' \\
\sigma_z'{}^* &= \text{OCR}\,\sigma_{z,0}' \\
\tau_{xy}^* &= \tau_{xy,0}, \quad
\tau_{yz}^* = \tau_{yz,0}, \quad
\tau_{zx}^* = \tau_{zx,0}
\end{aligned}
$$

The corresponding preconsolidation pressure:

$$
p_{c,0} = \tilde{p}'{}^* + \frac{q^{*2}}{M^2 \tilde{p}'{}^*}
$$

***

## Isotropic compression

For isotropic compression ($$\sigma_1' = \sigma_2' = \sigma_3' = p'$$), before yield:

$$
\dot{\varepsilon}_v = \frac{\kappa^*}{p'}\dot{p}'
$$

At yield ($$p' = p_c$$):

$$
\dot{\varepsilon}_v = \frac{\lambda^*}{p'}\dot{p}'
$$

Thus:

$$
\frac{d\varepsilon_v}{dp'} =
\begin{cases}
\frac{\kappa^*}{p'}, & p' < p_c \\
\frac{\lambda^*}{p'}, & p' = p_c
\end{cases}
$$

## Oedometric compression

In the oedometer test, all strains except the vertical are zero. The result is a bilinear relation:

$$
\frac{de}{d\log_{10}\sigma_v'} =
\begin{cases}
C_s, & \sigma_v' < \sigma_c \\
C_c, & \sigma_v' = \sigma_c
\end{cases}
$$

where

$$
e = (1 + e_0)(1 - \varepsilon_v) - 1
$$

and approximate conversions are:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\kappa^* &\approx \frac{C_s}{2.3(1 + e_0)} \\
\lambda^* &\approx \frac{C_c}{2.3(1 + e_0)}
\end{aligned}
$$

In OPTUM GX, the user has a choice between two parameter sets: A ($$\kappa^*, \lambda^*$$) or B ($$C_s, C_c$$); In the case of Set B, the above relations are used to calculate equivalent $$\kappa^*$$ and $$\lambda^*$$.
